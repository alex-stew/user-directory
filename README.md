# Use Directory

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then developed on further to create an interactive user directory.

## Usage
A React single page web application that lists a database of users and then enables the client to search and filter the results, useful in situations where basic example/dummy data is required for prototyping.
